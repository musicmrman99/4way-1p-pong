# Four-Way One-Player Pong
A four-way (horizontal and vertical), single-player (you control all paddles), never-ending (the game restarts when you loose - be prepared!) version of pong.

# History
Original development stopped 2014-09-02. Feel free to open a pull request if you want to contribute!

# Compilation
You can compile the `.bas` (FreeBASIC) file with the [freebasic compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/files/ "FreeBASIC Compiler on SourceFourge") (last tested with `fbc` version 1.05.0).

# Known Issues
- If the ball hits the *side* of a paddle, it will 'stick'.
  - This results in gaining score very rapidly, but inevitable failure
